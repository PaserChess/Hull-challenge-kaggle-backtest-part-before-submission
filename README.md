This project was made as part of the kaggle competition Hull tactical - Market prediction, where my task was to :
"predict the stock market returns as represented by the excess returns of the S&P 500 while also managing volatility constraints. Your work will test the Efficient Market Hypothesis and challenge common tenets of personal finance."
The results of my strategies can be easily understood with the wealth_accumulation.png file.
